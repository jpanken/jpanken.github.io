        <title>Scripts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we started this unit, I thought that scripts were just something that 
actors read.  It turns out that they are much more than that.  A script is a 
“program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by 
another program rather than by the computer processor.” 
(http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/definition/script)  They are an 
easy way to automate tasks that take up time and energy that I just don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written my thesis, but if I had to do it again, I would consider 
using a template and Pandoc. It would have been worth the effort to learn how to
write in markdown and convert it to multiple formats effortlessly.  As it was, 
it took me hours to format my dissertation (especially because it had a lot of 
images).  If there were going to write another one (never again!), I’ll use the 
techniques I learned in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My script is very basic, but it works.  I tried to figure out how to use a 
template so I could have indented paragraphs, but I didn’t have a lot of time to
mess around.  I also tried to color the document titles, but it didn’t work.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, I didn’t write down the code my professor used when he made a 
“Happy Birthday” script.  I tried Googling the information, but the codes I 
tried didn’t work.  There was probably some weird formatting issue with which 
I’m not familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class, I made a Mad Libs script.  It asked for different parts of speech and 
assembled some pretty funny sentences.  After writing the Mad Libs, I still had 
no idea how to write the commands to convert documents from markdown into 
different formats.  I figured it out by looking at the class notes and figuring
out how to designate variables from the various tutorials.  It took me awhile to
decide what document to convert, but turning it into markdown wasn’t very hard.
In the end, I converted the beginning of Chapter Four of my dissertation into 
markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excerpt discusses the work of American humanitarians in Turkey after the 
Armenian Genocide, 1915-1917.  In the chapter as a whole, I address the creation
of publicity photographs and other materials to raise money from the American 
public.  I discuss the creation and use of a particular photograph featuring a 
female physician, Dr. Mabel Elliott, and one of her starving patient.  You can 
find my converted documents at the following links:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflections on 161</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a good reader.  I taught myself to read at a young age and never left home without a book in hand.  As an undergrad and graduate student, I learned how to analyze historical monographs so that I could discuss them intelligently.  While studying for my oral exams, I read around five non-fiction books a day for three months straight.  That is my comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these skills seem applicable to INLS 161.  I am not used to following directions so closely.  It takes all of my concentration to keep up with the class.  If I make a mistake, I get left behind in the dust.  

&lt;p&gt;It took me hours of fiddling with hex codes to make the color scheme on my website work.  This was after googling &quot;color schemes for websites&quot; and experimenting to figure out what code controls which text.  In the end, I'm pretty happy with the soothing, muted color scheme.  On the other hand, I wanted to use background images, but I never figured that part out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a lot of work left on this website.  Ultimately, I want to create a space for sharing my millinery adventures.  This will require a lot of images to document my efforts so I will have to get comfortable with those features.  I'll figure it out; I always do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Millinery!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Millinery is really a form of sculpture.  First and foremost, it requires strong hands to withstand steam and manipulate stiff felt into different positions. It also requires some expensive tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hat blocks&lt;/i&gt; are the main expense for any aspiring milliner.  It is the canvas upon which you build your hat.  Unfortunately, hat block making is a dying art and precious few people currently make hat blocks.  If this is your first hat, you should check eBay for a basic block (shaped like a head).  Once you are more established, you might invest more seriously in a modular set. That way you can mix crowns and brims for different looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blankblock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;basic hat block&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a block, you need a &lt;i&gt;felt body&lt;/i&gt; to block.  Felt bodies (also called hoods or cones) are unblocked hats made out of wool or fur felt.  They come in many different colors and textures.  Wool felt is the cheapest kind of body (under $15), but fur felts (around $30) are much easier to work with.  Fur felts come in a variety of finishes, but flat and velour are the most popular.  Velour (also called peachbloom) has a nap on one or both sides.  The nap gives it a richer texture.  Melusine, on the other hand, has a true furry texture not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/felthood1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;felt body&quot; width=&quot;275&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hats keep their shape with the help of &lt;i&gt;stiffener&lt;/i&gt;, a glue-like spray that can dry quite hard if you aren't careful.  I mix up my own stiffener from hydrolac b5 powder, rubbing alcohol (try for at least 90% alcohol), and a bit of water.  It becomes a clear, slightly yellowish liquid and can be sprayed in light layers on the inside of the body.  Stiffener is also available pre-mixed, but who wants to ship a flammable liquid?  Powder is cheaper and easily shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steam is a key ingredient for blocking hats.  I use a &lt;i&gt;travel garment steamer&lt;/i&gt; to keep my felt pliable and set the stiffener.  Steam burns are a real hazard so be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garmentsteamer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;garment steamer&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pins are necessary to keep the felt in place as it dries.  I use &lt;i&gt;straight pins&lt;/i&gt; when I am hand-draping and &lt;i&gt;blocking pins&lt;/i&gt; when I am anchoring the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blockingpins.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blocking pins&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time, we'll discuss the process of blocking a hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here's a video of a hand-draping workshop with Jasmin Zorlu, it's supercool!&lt;/p&gt;
