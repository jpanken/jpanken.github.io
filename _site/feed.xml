        <title>Reflections on 161</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a good reader.  I taught myself to read at a young age and never left home without a book in hand.  As an undergrad and graduate student, I learned how to analyze historical monographs so that I could discuss them intelligently.  While studying for my oral exams, I read around five non-fiction books a day for three months straight.  That is my comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these skills seem applicable to INLS 161.  I am not used to following directions so closely.  It takes all of my concentration to keep up with the class.  If I make a mistake, I get left behind in the dust.  

&lt;p&gt;It took me hours of fiddling with hex codes to make the color scheme on my website work.  This was after googling &quot;color schemes for websites&quot; and experimenting to figure out what code controls which text.  In the end, I'm pretty happy with the soothing, muted color scheme.  On the other hand, I wanted to use background images, but I never figured that part out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a lot of work left on this website.  Ultimately, I want to create a space for sharing my millinery adventures.  This will require a lot of images to document my efforts so I will have to get comfortable with those features.  I'll figure it out; I always do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Millinery!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Millinery is really a form of sculpture.  First and foremost, it requires strong hands to withstand steam and manipulate stiff felt into different positions. It also requires some expensive tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hat blocks are the main expense for any aspiring milliner.  It is the canvas upon which you build your hat.  Unfortunately, hat block making is a dying art and precious few people currently make hat blocks.  If this is your first hat, you should check eBay for a basic block (shaped like a head).  Once you are more established, you might invest more seriously in a modular set. That way you can mix crowns and brims for different looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blankblock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;basic hat block&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a block, you need a felt body to block.  Felt bodies (also called hoods or cones) are unblocked hats made out of wool or fur felt.  They come in many different colors and textures.  Wool felt is the cheapest kind of body (under $15), but fur felts (around $30) are much easier to work with.  Fur felts come in a variety of finishes, but flat and velour are the most popular.  Velour (also called peachbloom) has a nap on one or both sides.  The nap gives it a richer texture.  Melusine, on the other hand, has a true furry texture not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/felthood1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;felt body&quot; width=&quot;275&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hats keep their shape with the help of stiffener, a glue-like spray that can dry quite hard if you aren't careful.  I mix up my own stiffener from hydrolac b5 powder, rubbing alcohol (try for at least 90% alcohol), and a bit of water.  It becomes a clear, slightly yellowish liquid and can be sprayed in light layers on the inside of the body.  Stiffener is also available pre-mixed, but who wants to ship a flammable liquid?  Powder is cheaper and easily shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steam is a key ingredient for blocking hats.  I use a travel garment steamer to keep my felt pliable and set the stiffener.  Steam burns are a real hazard so be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garmentsteamer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;garment steamer&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pins are necessary to keep the felt in place as it dries.  I use straight pins when I am hand-draping and blocking pins when I am anchoring the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blockingpins.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blocking pins&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time, we'll discuss the process of blocking a hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here's a video of a hand-draping workshop with Jasmin Zorlu, it's supercool!&lt;/p&gt;
