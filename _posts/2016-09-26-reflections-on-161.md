<p>I'm a good reader.  I taught myself to read at a young age and never left home without a book in hand.  As an undergrad and graduate student, I learned how to analyze historical monographs so that I could discuss them intelligently.  While studying for my oral exams, I read around five non-fiction books a day for three months straight.  That is my comfort zone. </p>

<p>None of these skills seem applicable to INLS 161.  I am not used to following directions so closely.  It takes all of my concentration to keep up with the class.  If I make a mistake, I get left behind in the dust.  

<p>It took me hours of fiddling with hex codes to make the color scheme on my website work.  This was after googling "color schemes for websites" and experimenting to figure out what code controls which text.  In the end, I'm pretty happy with the soothing, muted color scheme.  On the other hand, I wanted to use background images, but I never figured that part out.</p>

<p>I still have a lot of work left on this website.  Ultimately, I want to create a space for sharing my millinery adventures.  This will require a lot of images to document my efforts so I will have to get comfortable with those features.  I'll figure it out; I always do.</p>
